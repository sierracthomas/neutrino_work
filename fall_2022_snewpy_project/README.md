# Instructions:
- clone or copy (at least) `scripts/` locally
- be sure to have [SNOwGLoBES](https://github.com/SNOwGLoBES/snowglobes) and [SNEWPY](https://snewpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/gettingstarted.html#installation) installed
- start in `scripts/` folder to start by running SNEWPY
- open `generate.ipynb` and change some variables:
  - `SNOwGLoBES_path` to the path you've installed snowglobes in
  - `SNEWPY_models_base` to the path where your SNEWPY models live
  - update parameters like `detector`, `distance`, `transformation`....
  - change times to the times you'd like to run (NOTE: this varies by model, will get an error if your time does not fall within the parameters of the model)
  - in the second code-block, change the `modeltype` and `model` variables like `modeltype = matrix[x][0]` and `model = matrix[x][1]` where `x` corresponds to the row of model you want. Change the matrix if you don't see yours
  - Update `new_dir_fluence = ""` and `new_dir_interactions = ""` by putting your absolute path in the quotes. This is where your files will go once run - must be a real, empty directory.
  - when these have been updated, it's time to run. Run all code-blocks starting with the first
  - A list of commands will be outputted. Copy the group of commands under `Copy these for interactions` and paste into a terminal. Repeat with code under `Copy these for fluence`
- Now, it's time to graph and look at the data from SNEWPY. Open `fluence.ipynb` or `interactions.ipynb` - note that `fluence.ipynb` has more documentation
  - Here, you will also need to update some variables. Change `SNOwGLoBES_path` and `SNEWPY_models_base` like before. Change the time parameters to the same as you did for generate - this will throw an error if you do not.
  - When calling the plotting function, be sure to change `my_files` variable to the path where your interactions or fluence files live.
  - Be sure to change the `flavor` argument to whatever nuetrino flavor or interaction you would like to see
